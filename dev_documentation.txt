2025-08-09 00:00 - Add AI backend and integrate frontend to use OpenAI via server
2025-08-09 00:05 - Add Nutrition page with AI-generated meal plans
2025-08-09 00:12 - Voice assistant & UI enhancements
2025-08-09 00:24 - Voice MP3 flow, transcription endpoint, and analytics visuals
2025-08-09 02:30 - MAJOR UPGRADE: Enterprise-grade health copilot with advanced AI features

Changes:
- Backend: `/api/ai/transcribe` accepts `audio` form-data (webm/mp3), transcribes via `gpt-4o-transcribe` with fallback to `whisper-1`.
- Frontend: `VoiceAssistant` now records via MediaRecorder (no external encoder), uploads to server, then asks AI.
- Removed `mic-recorder-to-mp3` dependency to avoid Lame global error.
- Dashboard: added radar and scatter charts for health scoring and sleep-stress visualization.

Run:
- Restart both servers if needed: `npm run server` and `npm run dev`.


Changes:
- Backend: added `general_assistant` task in `server/index.js` for open-ended queries.
- Frontend:
  - New floating `VoiceAssistant` component (STT via Web Speech API, TTS via SpeechSynthesis) mounted in `App.tsx`.
  - New `Topbar` in `src/components/ui/topbar.tsx` and included in layout.
- No changes to build scripts; hot reload picks up updates.

Usage:
- Open app, bottom-right widget: tap ‚ÄúSpeak‚Äù, ask a question, then ‚ÄúAsk‚Äù to get AI response with optional TTS playback.

Security:
- Voice data is transcribed locally in-browser. Only the transcribed text is sent to the backend AI endpoint.


Changes:
- New `src/components/Nutrition.tsx` with inputs for preferences, profile, and goals, and a Generate button that calls AI.
- Sidebar: added `Nutrition` route with icon; App routes updated for `/nutrition`.
- Backend: extended prompt builder with new `nutrition_plan` task.
- API: extended `AiTask` type to include `nutrition_plan`.

How to test:
- Run backend and frontend (see earlier instructions), open `/nutrition` and click ‚ÄúGenerate Nutrition Plan‚Äù.


Changes:
- Added Express server at `server/index.js` with `/api/ai/generate` endpoint using OpenAI Chat Completions (model `gpt-4o-mini`).
- Configured Vite proxy in `vite.config.ts` for `/api` to `http://localhost:3001`.
- Updated `package.json` to add scripts: `server`, `dev:all` and dependencies: `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `openai`, and `concurrently`.
- Created `src/lib/api.ts` to centralize AI calls from the frontend.
- Integrated AI calls in UI:
  - `Dashboard.tsx`: loads an AI summary on mount (`dashboard_summary`).
  - `SymptomIntake.tsx`: sends user symptom context to AI (`symptom_analysis`).
  - `LabTracker.tsx`: interprets mock lab results via AI (`lab_interpretation`).
  - `ProviderSearch.tsx`: generates visit prep summary (`visit_prep_summary`).

Environment:
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a `.env` file at the project root. Do not commit.

Security & notes:
- API key stays on server. Frontend calls only `/api` endpoints.
- Responses are rendered as plain text with whitespace preserved.

How to run:
1) `npm i`
2) Create `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
3) In one terminal: `npm run server`
4) In another: `npm run dev` (or `npm run dev:all` to run both)

2025-08-10 02:34 - Set OPENAI_API_KEY and enabled live AI responses. Added predictions endpoint and guards earlier; verified health and /api/ai/generate works.
2025-08-10 02:51 - Added runtime OpenAI key API and health validation; ensured EnhancedChat input has id/name; voice-chat route added earlier. To enable live AI, call POST /api/admin/openai-key with a valid key. See README for deploy notes.
